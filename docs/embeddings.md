# Embeddings API

The Embeddings API allows you to get vector representations of text that can be used for search, clustering, recommendations, and other applications.

## Creating Embeddings

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "The food was delicious and the waiter...",
    "model": "text-embedding-ada-002"
  }'
```

## Response Format

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "embedding",
      "embedding": [0.0023064255, -0.009327292, ...],
      "index": 0
    }
  ],
  "model": "text-embedding-ada-002",
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 8,
    "total_tokens": 8
  }
}
```
